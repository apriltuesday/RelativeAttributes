LIBSVM Code link (this one should be used, because this uses weights on instances) 

www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/weights/libsvm-weights-3.17.zip

svmtrain and svmpredict should be mex compiled for usage.

*************************************************************************************************

Main file:

[classification_accuracy] = JCA_AR(weight_flag,active_version,uniform_flag,weight_active_flag)

This code learns the attribute and category models simultaneously

weight_flag=1; if cvpr 2013 weighting scheme is used, otherwise 0

active_version=1; if cvpr 2013 active learning scheme is used

-1 if no active learning scheme is used

0 if max entropy active learning scheme is used

uniform_flag=1 and weight_active_flag=0 always!

Variables which can be changed in the file:

NRUN = maximum number of runs, should be 200 or more for Pubfig-900-60, otherwise curve will not be smooth
It is usually slow for Pubfig-900-60, so for many runs parallel processing is strongly recommended.

total_increment_in_training_size= how many iterations you ask people (300 is used for Pubfig-900-60)

*************************************************************************************************

data.mat: The data file with features and class labels, this is Pubfig-900-60 data.

human_attribute_results_1.mat: Amazon Mechanical Turk Data was stored in this file to access while

running our experiments

train_test_and_validation_ids_multiple.mat: Storing some initial train-test splits such that several 

algorithms run with the same train-test split

learn_the_attribute_model, ranksvm_with_sim: These are used for relative attribute learning
